                    You may travel to certain destinations which involve greater risks than others, entirely at your

                    international destinations, ITLWorld does not represent or warrant that travel to such point is
                    advisable or without risk. ITLWorld does not accept liability for damages, losses, or delays that
                    may result from improper documents for entry, exit, length of stay, or from travel to such
                    destinations. ITLWorld reserves its exclusive right in its sole discretion to alter, limit or
